# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 

We will have our group meeting every Tuesday 5-6 PM, using a Discord online call or Zoom. We will take notes in a shared Google Drive folder. 

2. **Assistance** 

We have a Discord group chat and an iMessage group chat to contact each other. We should respond to each other's messages within 24 hours. 

3. **Respect** 

We will take turns speaking in our meeting about our progress and problems, and then the members will give feedback. If two members have different opinions, we will discuss both ideas and then decide. We’ve worked on other projects together and know how to work well together and know how we all communicate best. 

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
We will assign workload each week depending on everyone’s time commitments that week and what everyone feels most comfortable working on. We’ll address unexpected complications as they arise, and if someone is having a hard time a certain week, the rest of us can help out with their assigned task. If we have unexpected problems with our project, we can always reach out to our mentor to ask what our next steps should be, and go from there. 

5. **Time Commitment** 
We’re expecting 5-6 hours per week from each team member, as this project is comparable to an MP. We’re all busy but we’re all already aware of each other’s time commitments as we’re working together on our CS222 project. We know how to help each other out when someone’s having a particularly busy week. If someone has an unexpected time commitment for a certain week, we’ll just give them a smaller task for that week and they can catch up the next week. 

6. **Conflict Resolution** 
We will communicate with each other to resolve our issues. We will also consult everyone on our team on the matter in a democratic process to ensure everyone can have their say. In our time working together, we have not had much team friction so we’re not too concerned about having large disagreements. In a situation where members have not accomplished their tasks, we will simply sit down and talk about it. This would be really unlike any one of us, so it might be the case that there’s something else going on other than laziness or irresponsibility. In a situation where one or more members are late, we’ll again just talk to each other about it and maybe set a different meeting time that’s better for everyone. There are not really any other potential issues that we’re concerned about, but if the need arises we will discuss with our mentor.
