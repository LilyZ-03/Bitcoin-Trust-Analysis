# Development Log (Date:10/31/22 -- 11/4/22)

## Weekly Goals
This week, our goal was to finish the project proposal and team contract. We were able to accomplish this goal just on time.

## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
Since this was a task for our whole team, everybody (Anagha, Anjana, Trisha and Lily) met for a few hours this week to work on the project proposal and team contract, and no one had a singular specific task.

## Problems Encountered 
The only problem that we encountered was that halfway through, we had to change our dataset because it was not compatible with the algorithms we were planning to use. However, we were able to find a new dataset, and luckily, this did not prevent us from meeting our goal.

## Plans for next week
Next week, we plan to complete a function to parse the dataset and store it in our data structure, which will be a std::map. 

## Optional: Questions for mentor
N/A
