# Development Log (Date: 11/7/22 -- 11/11/22)

## Weekly Goals
This week, our goal was to set up the basic structure of our codebase, including our Graph class and our Makefile. We also aimed to parse all the data points from our dataset and load it into our graph data structure. We were able to accomplish all these tasks. Also, since our dataset did not contain any invalid data, we were able to parse the data successfully without performing any data validation.

## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
What specific tasks each member of your team accomplished in the week?

Trisha Choudhary (trishac2):
- Worked on building the codebase (Makefile, Graph class, and other folders)

Anagha Shenoy (anaghas2): 
- Worked on updating the GitHub repository with the codebase and helped with building the codebase

Anjana Gulapalyam (anjanag3):
- Worked on the Makefile and helped with parsing the data

Lily Zhang (shuxing3):
- Worked on parsing the data and putting it into our graph data structure

## Problems Encountered 
We ran into issues creating our Makefile and subsequently adding the build directory. We attended office hours and were able to receive assistance from a staff member to solve these issues. Because of this, we were able to achieve our goals this week.

## Plans for next week
Even though our dataset had no invalid data, we would still like to write code to validate the data by next week so that possibly other datasets (containing differently formatted data points) can be fed into our final algorithm. We do not anticipate data validation to be a demanding task because it only requires the addition of a few simple conditional statements.

We will start programming our algorithms next week. We plan to start with DFS and then move onto Djikstraâ€™s if we have enough time.

## Optional: Questions for mentor
