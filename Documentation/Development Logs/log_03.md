# Development Log (Date: 11/14/22 -- 11/18/22)

## Weekly Goals
This week, our goal was to complete the DFS traversal of our graph to remove the negatively weighted and weakly related edges. We also wanted to complete validating the data after we parsed the data last week.

## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
We relied on VS Code Live Share and all collaborated on writing the DFS graph traversal as well as the unit tests for the graph constructor and the traversal. We also created a unit test for one of our private helper functions and for our DFS traversal. The DFS traversal algorithm is complete!

## Problems Encountered 
We ran into an issue where our DFS traversal was not working correctly because we had not accounted for the fact that the entire graph was not a single connected component. We attended office hours and were able to figure out this issue, and corrected it by adding an extra for loop. 

## Plans for next week
The week after break, we plan to finish Tarjanâ€™s algorithm and test it. This way we have more time to work on an algorithm we are unfamiliar with.

## Optional: Questions for mentor
N/A
